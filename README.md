# URL Shortner

This app takes a long url and creates a short url that maps to it. When a user uses that short url it redirects to the long url using the mapping.

For example when the service runs under the domain https://short.com this URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page/123456 should look like this https://short.com/c9eo1 after being shortened. When calling https://short.com/c9eo1 a user should be redirected to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page/123456.
